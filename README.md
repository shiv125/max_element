# max_element
maximum element in a stack
This project is based on this question..

""You have an empty sequence, and you will be given  queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1 x  -Push the element x into the stack.
2    -Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3    -Print the maximum element in the stack.""

In the above problem we can also use array but it will take O(n) time . In order to optimize the solution , i have used data structure 
stack. Here i have used 2 stacks , one is to mantaining the record of elements and another to get maximum element
